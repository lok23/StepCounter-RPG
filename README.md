# What is this?
StepCounter-RPG is a 2-in-1 application that combines the functionality of a traditional step-counter fitness app with the ability to spend those hard earned steps on upgrades for your in-game character. Much like traditional fitness apps, steps are tracked and graphed over a daily or weekly period of time. These graphs contain information such as how many steps you walked an hour, calories burned, distance walked etc. The gameplay element consists of spending your step-coins on buying food, buying entertainment, working jobs, or getting a degree for your in-game character. 

Here's a look at some of the app's screens.

## Purpose
The purpose of this app is to demonstrate our understanding of basic Android development. We declared permissions, sensors, and activities in the Android Manifest. We used intents to navigate from one activity to another. We used hardware sensors to detect steps, then wrote our own code to encapsulate that information in a visually appealing format. Progress whether in the form of progress towards a daily step goal, or progress towards an in-game degree are measured using ProgressBars. Lists are displayed using RecyclerView and CardView.
